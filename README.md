# MyTierList

MyTierList is a small project created to facilitate the organization of tier lists for personal use, usable completely offline
hence without sending data to a server.

## Motivations

It feels to me that the most popular tools in this category focuses primarily on the sharing aspect of tier lists, while I just
want to organize my stuff so I can have a better understanding of the games I play, for example. I also wanted to have a project
where I could use some of the technologies I've been learning lately, such as Tailwind.
